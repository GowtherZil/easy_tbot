# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Users can report vurnelavilities preferably by writing an issue. Security updates will be made to the extent of the development team (currently me and some friends). When a user reports vulnerabilities, it will be tried to reproduce through unit tests, if they are right they will be accepted if not rejected. In any case, the user in question will be informed of the decision.
