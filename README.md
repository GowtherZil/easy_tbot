# easy_tbot

Mini framework for database and other useful stuff integration with Telegram bot api

## Motivation

The biggest motivation was when I wanted to make my first bot on Telegram using python. I had many modules like telethon or pyTelegramBotApi but it did not solve the idea of how to structure the project, how to make it join a database and other integrations. The most important thing if I wanted to do another project, would I have to repeat all the code? Thus was born easy_tbot. Another motivation that came as a divine sign was to try to copy (test purpose) a friend's bot, a .py of more than 3000 lines of code -_-

## Documentation

See our [wiki](https://github.com/Gaspect/easy_tbot/wiki/Starting).

## What are we?

- A framework.
- A component-oriented system.
- The VERY higher layer of what is desired in most telegram bots.
- An idea.

## What are we not?

- A telegram api wrapper.
